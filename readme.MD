# Rust Playground: A Dive into Basic Rust Concepts ðŸ¦€

Welcome to the Rust Playground! 
This repository serves as an illustrative guide for beginners in Rust programming. Each code section lightly explores specific Rust concepts in a simplified manner, providing a hands-on approach to understanding Rust's unique features such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, iterators, and more. This is aimed to work as an overview, and does not intend to do any kind of thorough study of the language. To understand this repo you need to have an overview of Rust and an understanding of programming concepts.

### Basic Printing and Variables

Introduction to simple print statements and variable declarations. Demonstrates the concept of immutability and the usage of basic variables.

### Functions and Ownership

Explore the ownership rules, passing, and returning values in functions. Learn how ownership and borrowing rules apply to function parameters and return values.

### References and Mutability

Learn about references, borrowing, and mutability. Understand how to use mutable references and the rules around them.

### Macros

Introduction to macros in Rust. Understand how macros look like function calls but operate at the syntactic level.

### Attributes

Learn about attributes in Rust. Attributes are used to add metadata to code for conditional compilation and various other purposes.

### Traits

Explore traits, a way to share method signatures across multiple structs or enums. Understand how to implement traits for custom types.

### Control Flow

Learn about different control flow constructs like if-else, match, loops, and iterators.

### If Let

Understand the `if let` syntax for pattern matching. It allows for a less verbose way to handle values matching complex patterns.

### Match

Explore the `match` statement, a powerful control flow operator that allows for exhaustive pattern matching.

### Loops

Learn about different loops available in Rust such as loop, while, and for. 

### Closures

Explore closures, anonymous functions that have the ability to capture values from their scope.

### Iterators

Learn about iterators, lazy value generators that can be used to work with sequences of elements in a more abstract way.

### Rust Primitives and Collections

Explore Rustâ€™s various data types and collection types such as arrays, tuples, and vectors.
